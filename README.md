## Installation

You can use this gem by putting the following inside your Gemfile:

## Usage

You need [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for the styling and close button. You can still use it without Bootstrap, but you need to style it yourself. This gem uses the [Bootstrap alerts](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#alerts).

If you're [customizing Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html), make sure to grab the "Alert Messages", "Component Animations", and "Transitions" (The latter two are optional, unless you want the fade-out animation on close).

All flash messages are defined inside config/locales/flash.en.yml. They are nested like this:

    en:
      flash_messages:
        controller_name:
          action_name:
            success: "It worked!"
            info: "There's something you need to know..."
            warning: "You should watch out now."
            error: "Oh no! Something went wrong."

You have four keys:
    
    :success
    :info
    :warning
    :error

When you've defined the messages it's really easy to call them inside your Controller.

    class PostsController
      def create
        @post = Post.new(params[:post])
        if @post.save
          redirect_to(@post, :flash => :success)
        else
          flash_now!(:error)
          render("new")
        end
      end
    end

You can use the `:flash` parameter inside the `redirect_to` method (note: this gem changes the redirect_to method!) to set the flash messages. You only need to pass the corresponding key and the gem will automatically set `flash[:success]` to `t("flash_messages.posts.create.success")`. The `:flash` parameter also accepts an Array.

    redirect_to(@post, :flash => [:success, :info])

You can still use a Hash to use the default `redirect_to` behavior. When you don't want to use the `redirect_to` method to set the flash messages, you can use the `flash!` method.

    flash!(:success, :info)
    redirect_to(@post)

When you need to use `flash.now` you can use the new `flash_now!` method.

    flash_now!(:error, :warning)

You use `flash_now!` in combination with rendering a view instead of redirecting.

Now's the time to show these messages to the user. Inside the layout (or any other view), add the following:

    <div id="flash_messages"><%= flash_messages %></div>

And that's it! To change the flash messages inside a `.js.erb` file, you can do the following:

    $("#flash_messages").html("#{j(flash_messages)}");

The `flash_messages` helper shows a simple Bootstrap alert box. If you want to add a close button you can add the `:close` option.

    <%= flash_messages(:close) %>

If you'd like for the flash message to fade out when you click on the close icon, you can pass in the `:fade` option. This requires `:close` to work, obviously.

    <%= flash_messages(:close, :fade) %>

Want to use the `.alert-block` class? Just add `:block`.

    <%= flash_messages(:close, :block) %>

Want a heading? Add `:heading`. The headings inside flash.en.yml are used for the headings.

    <%= flash_messages(:close, :block, :heading) %>

Need to display HTML inside the flash messages? Use the `:html` option.

    <%= flash_messages(:html) %>

It's also possible to convert new-lines (\n) into br-tags using the `:convert_newlines` option. This option also unescapes all other HTML, so use it with care.

    <%= flash_messages(:convert_newlines) %>

And that's it! Have fun. :)

## Interpolation

You can use i18n interpolation like this:

    redirect_to :root, :flash => [:success, :info], :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email }
    flash! :success, :info, :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email }
    flash_now! :success, :info, :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email }

Inside `flash.en.yml` you can do the following:

    success: "Welcome, %{name}."
    info: "Your e-mail address has been changed to: %{email}."


## Why I created this gem

I created the [gritter gem](https://github.com/RobinBrouwer/gritter) and used it in a lot of projects.
I started using Twitter Bootstrap and really liked the alerts. I loved the way gritter allowed you to set messages
and decided to do the same for the Bootstrap alerts. And this is the result!
